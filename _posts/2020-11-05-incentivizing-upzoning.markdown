Gainesville has a housing shortage which is causing an affordability crisis. There is a demand for housing nearer to centers of activity and employment, particularly downtown Gainesville. (Citation needed) There is little undeveloped land in Gainesville, but most of this land is underdeveloped. If Gainesville is to sustain or improve its services, it needs to use its land more productively (Gainesville finances).

A large barrier to housing construction is the tendency to zone land as restrictively as possible. In so doing, we often find that buildings which already exist in a neighborhood - buildings which make up the character of a neighborhood - do not conform to the zoning regulation. (Nonconforming map)

In order to build more densely, upzoning is needed. Upzoning is a long, political process. (Describe upzoning process)
