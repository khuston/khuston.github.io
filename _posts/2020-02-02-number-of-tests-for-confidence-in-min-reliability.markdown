A Bernoulli trial has two possible outcomes: success or failure. Let's define _reliability_ as the statistical fraction of outcomes which are successful. We can then ask, what is our _confidence_ that the reliability meets or exceeds a minimum threshold.

$$r \geq m$$

|------------------------|
| Variable | Description |
| $$r$$    | Reliability |
| $$c$$    | Confidence  |
| $$m$$    | Min. Reliability |
|-----------------------------|


|------------------------|
| Variable | Description |
| r    | Reliability |
| c    | Confidence  |
| m    | Min. Reliability |
|-----------------------------|


If we want a certain level of confidence that some fraction of Bernoulli trials will be successful.
We may want to achieve a certain level of confidence that our process or product is successful a minimum percentage of the time.
